## Hafez divination project
The purpose of this project is to make a simple fortune telling program. In this program, when entering, there is an option at the bottom of the screen to get a horoscope. By pressing it, one of Hafez's poems entered in the program is randomly selected and displayed to the user. The user can get another fortune by pressing that button again.

This program, contains 5 different poems of Hafez in the program and display one of them randomly.

Also, next to the fortune telling button, there should be another button called "About the program" that provides general information about the program, such as the version number and its author.
There are details such as what information or instructions are displayed on the page at the beginning of entering the program.
A theme is designed for the whole program so that your program has a different state from other programs (for example, because of the combination of colors and fonts for different sections).

## E-book project 
In this project, a book display part of a book reader system is created. On the first page, you will see a list of books. This includes the book cover image, book title, and author name. For this page, the user can view the list as a list in which the books are displayed below each other. The user can click on the book image to see more information about the book. In this case, another page should be displayed, in which the image of the book is displayed first, and below it, information about the book such as author, publisher, year of publication, edition, summary, etc. is displayed.

## Currency exchanger project
The purpose of this project is to use live data in the application. This is a currency conversion program that allows the user to easily convert money between different currencies. This program, supports the currencies of Rial, US Dollar, Canadian Dollar, British Pound, Euro, and UAE Dirham. For each currency, a text display/text input field that displays the equivalent of the amount in that currency, and next to it, the flag of the country that represents that currency should be displayed. In this program, the user should be able to enter a number in the corresponding field of each currency, and as soon as that number changes, its equivalent in other currencies should be calculated and displayed. For example, if the number 10 is entered against the Euro, the equivalent of 10 Euros must be calculated in other currencies and displayed against the other currencies. For currency conversion rates, the conversion rates on the first day of December 2022 is used.

## Meteorology
The purpose of this project is to practice how to call web services and display their results. In this application, we want a weather application. A list of provinces and cities is displayed and the user can choose the desired city. It should also be possible to detect the user's current location automatically. After determining the location by the user, the program should receive the weather forecast for the next 5 days and display it to the user.The following service is used to get the weather forecast (and also convert the city name to geographic coordinates) https://openweathermap.org/forecast5

As a result of the weather forecast, this project should also use the appropriate icon for the situation (for example, cloudy or rainy). In addition, on the page, the name of the desired place and the time of receiving the information should also be displayed.
